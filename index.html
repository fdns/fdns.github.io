Hello, I'm Felipe Espinoza, a recently graduated Software Engineer and Lead Engineer in the Online Education Proyect at Universidad de Chile. I like exploring open source projects and apply them to my needs, loving the way we can change, adapt and contribute back to all the open projects that you publish. Now exploring the HashiCorp tools like Vault, Consul and Nomad, and CI tools like Concourse to improve our workflow at work.
