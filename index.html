I'm Felipe Espinoza, Software Engineer and Lead Engineer in the Online Education project at Universidad de Chile. I like exploring open source projects, trying to automate everything I can, applying devops practices to speed up the development cycles and document all the steps needed software up and running the fastest and safest way.
